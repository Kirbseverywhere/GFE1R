[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarth][CloseEyes][DisableBlinking].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadJagen]Prince Marth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][EnableBlinking][OpenEyes]Ah! Jagen![A] I didn't see you,[NL]
standing there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What were you thinking of, milord?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, it's... it's nothing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Now, now.[A][NL]
You don't expect me to believe that,[NL]
do you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hah. You always could read me like a book,[NL]
Jagen...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, what were you thinking of?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's...[....] the day we all escaped from Altea.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You think of that day often, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How can I not?[A] My family, my home...[NL]
All taken from me.[A] And my people,[NL]
they live under Dolhr's rule,[A][NL]
whilst I sit here,[NL]
biding my time like a coward![A]
[OpenMidRight]The day will soon come when we shall[NL]
pick up Altea's standard.[A] We shall march[NL]
into battle, and restore peace to the land.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I've been told this same thing[NL]
for the past year...[A][NL]
We've been planning to depart for so long...[A][NL]
Yet we hide away on Talys, waiting for what?[A][NL]
Our allies in Aurelis, the last sovereign state...[A][NL]
They're fighting, they fight the Alliance[NL]
every day![A] We should be there, Jagen,[NL]
standing by their side!
[OpenMidRight]And yet we wait.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]For what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]For you to lead us into battle, sire.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right now, the future is dim...[NL]
I grant you that.[A][NL]
But our men stand, [NL]
ready to fight by your side![A][NL]
We stand ready to fight against the darkness,[NL]
to join you in striving,[A][NL]
to create a better tomorrow.[A][NL]
We simply await your orders, Prince Marth.[A][NL]
Only you can decide[NL]
when you are ready to march...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[....][A][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
