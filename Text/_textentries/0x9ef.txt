[OpenFarLeft]Ah! We've finally found Lord Marth![A]

[OpenFarRight]Oh...? You are?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]My name is Norne.[A][NL]
I used to live in one of the villages[NL][A]
near Altea Castle, until those damned[NL]
Sable Knights came an'[A][NL]
ruined everything.[A]

[OpenFarRight]I'm very sorry to hear that, Miss Norne.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I'm just a lowly village girl.[A][NL]
No need for pleasantries, Lord Marth.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Alright, Norne, as you wish.[NL]
What brings you here to Talys?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]My friend [Tact] told me that you needed[NL]
loyal soldiers to assist you on your journey,[NL][A]
and that you'd be in Talys.[A][NL]
[Tact] was a knight in training you see,[NL]
an' he told me to come along[NL][A]
with him to protect you, Lord Marth.[NL]
So I went on and packed up all my bows[NL][A]
and kissed my grams goodbye[NL]
before coming here.[A]

[OpenFarRight]Well Norne, we could use loyal Alteans[NL]
like you and [Tact][A][NL]
to help us save King Mostyn.[A][NL]
It'll be a pleasure to fight alongside you.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]Tee hee![NL]
We won't disappoint, Lord Marth![A][NL]
I'll go get [Tact] right now.[A][NL]
From here on out, we're knights of Altea![A][2NL]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
Wait... [Tact]... Don't tell me you forgot[NL]
your weapons again! You dummy![A][NL]
Ugh, go buy them at the local armory,[NL]
I guess. Here's some money.[A]
