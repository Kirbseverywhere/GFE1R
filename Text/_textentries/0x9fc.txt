[OpenMidRight]Navarre![A][NL]
Since when does a swordsman of your caliber[NL]
fall in with thieves and cutthroats?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? Who are you?[A][NL]
Fly away, girl, before someone[NL]
clips your wings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please, Navarre. Why not use your talents[NL]
for a good, just cause?[A][NL]
Leave this rabble.[NL]
Lend your sword to Altea.[A][NL]
Or, if you will not,[NL]
then turn it on me instead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Nay, I'll turn no blade of mine[NL]
on a woman.[A][NL]
If you're willing to pay for my services[NL]
with your life[A][NL]
then consider yourself the high bidder.[NL]
My sword is yours.[A][X]
