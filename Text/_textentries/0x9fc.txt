Hey, c'mon Lena, shake a leg![A][OpenFarLeft][LoadLena][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][NL]
We need to get out of the Teeth, [NL]
and we need to do it now![A][OpenMidLeft]
Julian, wait...[A][OpenMidRight]
No, rumor has it that Altean Knights[NL]
are at the foot of the mountain.[A][NL]
We won't get a better chance[NL]
than this, it's just a bit farther.[A][NL]
Just stick with me.[A][OpenMidLeft]
Julian, I'm sorry...[A][NL][MoveMidLeft]
I left my Mend staff behind, it's very [NL]
precious to me...[....] You go on ahead.[A][NL][MoveMidLeft]
Save yourself![.] Here, I can use this Warp [NL]
staff to send you someplace safe-[NL][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Nuh-uh, honey, no can do. [A][NL]
I didn't betray my boys back there[NL]
so you can zap me out of here alone.[A][NL]
Forget the staff. I'll come back [NL]
later and get it for you, all right?[A][NL][MoveMidRight]
Right now, though, I need you to run![NL]
Tick-tock, now move that frock![A][OpenMidLeft]
Julian, I...[....] Yes, I'm sorry, let's go.[A][X]
