Hey, c'mon Lena, shake a leg![A][OpenFarLeft][LoadLena][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][NL]
We need to get out of the Teeth, [NL]
and we need to do it now![A][OpenMidLeft]
Julian, wait...[A][OpenMidRight]
No, rumor has it that Altean Knights[NL]
are at the foot of the mountain.[A][NL]
We won't get a better chance[NL]
than this, it's just a bit farther.[A][NL]
Just stick with me.[A][OpenMidLeft]
Julian, I'm sorry...[A][NL][MoveMidLeft]
I left my Mend staff behind, it's very [NL]
precious to me...[....] You go on ahead.[A][NL][MoveMidLeft]
Save yourself![.] Here, I can use this Warp [NL]
staff to send you someplace safe-[NL][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Nuh-uh, honey, no can do. [A][NL]
I didn't betray my boys back there[NL]
so you can zap me out of here alone.[A][NL]
Forget the staff. I'll come back [NL]
later and get it for you, all right?[A][NL][MoveMidRight]
Right now, though, I need you to run![NL]
Tick-tock, now move that frock![A][OpenMidLeft]
Julian, I...[....] Yes, I'm sorry, let's go.[A][X]

##Chapter3Outro
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMalledus][OpenMidRight][LoadMarth][OpenMidLeft]
Sire, we've arrived at the Samsooth Mountains.[A][OpenMidRight]
Alright. Knights, be on your guard, bandits [NL]
have been making this their home for years.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadCaeda]
Marth, look![MoveMidLeft][NL]
Is that someone heading towards us?[A][OpenMidRight]
Caeda, you're right! The bandits are moving![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadJagen]
Sire! We must strike, now![A][OpenMidRight]
Right, everyone! To arms![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNavarre][OpenMidRight][LoadCaeda]
[OpenMidRight]Navarre![A][NL]
Since when does a swordsman of your caliber[NL]
fall in with thieves and cutthroats?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? Who are you?[A][NL]
Fly away, girl, before someone[NL]
clips your wings.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Please, Navarre. Why not use your talents[NL]
for a good, just cause?[A][NL]
Leave this rabble.[NL]
Lend your sword to Altea.[A][NL]
Or, if you will not,[NL]
then turn it on me instead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]...Nay, I'll turn no blade of mine[NL]
on a woman.[A][NL]
If you're willing to pay for my services[NL]
with your life[A][NL]
then consider yourself the high bidder.[NL]
My sword is yours.[A][X]
