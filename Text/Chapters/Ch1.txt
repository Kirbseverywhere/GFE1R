[OpenMidLeft][LoadMarth][CloseEyes][DisableBlinking].....[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadJagen]Prince Marth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][EnableBlinking][OpenEyes]Ah! Jagen![A] I didn't see you,[NL]
standing there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What were you thinking of, milord?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, it's... it's nothing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Now, now.[A][NL]
You don't expect me to believe that,[NL]
do you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hah. You always could read me like a book,[NL]
Jagen...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, what were you thinking of?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's...[....] the day we all escaped from Altea.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You think of that day often, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How can I not?[A] My family, my home...[NL]
All taken from me.[A] And my people,[NL]
they live under Dolhr's rule,[A][NL]
whilst I sit here,[NL]
biding my time like a coward![A]
[OpenMidRight]The day will soon come when we shall[NL]
pick up Altea's standard.[A] We shall march[NL]
into battle, and restore peace to the land.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, I've been told this same thing[NL]
for the past year...[A][NL]
We've been planning to depart for so long...[A][NL]
Yet we hide away on Talys,[NL]
waiting for what?[A][NL]
Our allies in Aurelis,[NL]
the last sovereign state...[A][NL]
They're fighting, they fight the Alliance[NL]
every day![A] We should be there, Jagen,[NL]
standing by their side!
[OpenMidRight]And yet we wait.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]For what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]For you to lead us into battle, sire.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right now, the future is dim...[NL]
I grant you that.[A][NL]
But our men stand, [NL]
ready to fight by your side![A][NL]
We stand ready to fight,[NL]
against the darkness,[A][NL]
to join you in striving,[A][NL]
to create a better tomorrow.[A][NL]
We simply await your orders, Prince Marth.[A][NL]
Only you can decide[NL]
when you are ready to march...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see...[....][A][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

You look white as a sheet![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCaeda]
[OpenMidLeft]Marth, come quickly![A][NL]
It's the castle! Galder's pirates[NL]
attacked from out of nowhere.[A][NL]
They stormed the gates and[NL]
cut down everyone in their path![A][NL]
I Fear for my father's life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Steady, Caeda.[A][NL]
You did well to come find us.[A][NL]
Altea's bravest knights aren't about[NL]

Aren't you excited to see some combat!![A]
[OpenMidLeft][....]...Violence is not something to glorify.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, yeah, yeah![A][NL]
BUT! It'll be so cool![A][NL]
Watch! I'm gonna take down all the pirates![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sure... But stay behind me.[A][NL]
My armor will keep you from[NL]
having an untimely Death.[A]

Prince Marth has called us to arms.[A][NL]
There are pirates attacking Talys![A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]We must ride quickly, then![A][NL]
I won't allow those disgusting pirates[NL]
to lay even a finger on Prince Marth![A]

##NorneAndMURecruitementText
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNorne][OpenFarRight][LoadMarth]
[OpenFarLeft]Ah! We've finally found Lord Marth![A]

[OpenFarRight]Oh...? You are?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]My name is Norne.[A][NL]
I used to live in one of the villages[NL]
[A]
near Altea Castle, until those damned[NL]
Sable Knights came an'[A][NL]
ruined everything.[A]

[OpenFarRight]I'm very sorry to hear that, Miss Norne.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I'm just a lowly village girl.[A][NL]
No need for pleasantries, Lord Marth.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Alright, Norne, as you wish.[NL]
What brings you here to Talys?[A]

[OpenFarLeft]My friend [Tact] told me that you needed[NL]
loyal soldiers to assist you on your journey,[NL]
[A]
and that you'd be in Talys.[A][NL]
[Tact] was a knight in training you see,[NL]
an' he told me to come along[NL]
[A]
with him to protect you, Lord Marth.[NL]
So I went on and packed up all my bows[NL]
[A]
and kissed my grams goodbye[NL]
before coming here.[A]

[OpenFarRight]Well Norne, we could use loyal Alteans[NL]
like you and [Tact][A][NL]
to help us save King Mostyn.[A][NL]
It'll be a pleasure to fight alongside you.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]Tee hee![NL]
We won't disappoint, Lord Marth![A][NL]
I'll go get [Tact] right now.[A][NL]
From here on out, we're knights of Altea![A][2NL]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft]
Oh, by the way, I brought a bit of Money.[A][N]
I hope that'll help![A]
