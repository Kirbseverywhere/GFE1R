# Engine Additions:

Skill System, by FEU Wizards Corp., with edits from me(which have been pushed to the main skill system, as far as I know)(http://feuniverse.us/t/fe8-skill-system-v1-0-151-skills-done-more-on-the-way/2312)(https://github.com/FireEmblemUniverse/SkillSystem_FE8/)
	Which itself includes:
	-Personal and Class skills, along with equipped Item skills, which allows to add more layers to fights
	-HP Bars
	-Effectiveness notification bubble
	-Togglable total enemy range
	-Stat debuffs
	-Expansion of save data
	-Tons of small other convenient things
	
[Halfbodies](https://github.com/Kirbseverywhere/GFE1R/blob/master/Engine%20Hacks/Asm%20Hacks/Portraits.event), by me, an expansion of the portrait system to be bigger and allow for the bodies to be showed on the screen.(hence halfbody.)

And More!
